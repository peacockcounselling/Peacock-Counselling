            <h2>About</h2>
            <hr style="width:100%;border:solid black"> 
            <p>Having worked for a CAMHS team specialising in looked after children for over a decade, working with children who are looked after or adopted is my primary interest and my main area of expertise. My doctoral study additionally focussed on the use of Theraplay with children who have experienced relational and developmental trauma of the kind that is often part of the early experiences of children who are looked after or adopted.</p>
            <p>Working through the lenses of attachment theory and Theraplay, I work with children, their families, and - where appropriate - their wider networks of adults, to cultivate a more secure attachment between child and their primary care givers.  Where necessary, I adapt Theraplay and integrate other modalities, although Theraplay remains my core model. I draw on sensory integration ideas,  trauma processing via bilateral stimulation, therapeutic life story work, parental psychoeducation and/or therapy, and non-directive play based methods.</p>
            <p>Each child and family receives a tailored package based on a Marschak Interaction Method (MIM) assessment and other assessments as required.</p>
            <p>Please note I can only take on work with adopted children and families where this is commissioned by a registered adoption agency.</p>
