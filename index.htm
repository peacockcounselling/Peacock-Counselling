    <h2>About</h2>
    <hr>
    <p>Having worked for a CAMHS team specializing in looked after children for over a decade, working with children who are looked after or adopted is my primary interest and my main area of expertise. My doctoral study additionally focused on the use of Theraplay with children who have experienced relational and developmental trauma of the kind that is often part of the early experiences of children who are looked after or adopted.</p>
    <p>Working through the lenses of attachment theory and Theraplay, I work with children, their families, and - where appropriate - their wider networks of adults, to cultivate a more secure attachment between child and their primary caregivers.  Where necessary, I adapt Theraplay and integrate other modalities, although Theraplay remains my core model. I draw on sensory integration ideas,  trauma processing via bilateral stimulation, therapeutic life story work, parental psychoeducation and/or therapy, and non-directive play based methods.</p>
    <p>Each child and family receives a tailored package based on a Marschak Interaction Method (MIM) assessment and other assessments as required.</p>
    <p>Please note I can only take on work with adopted children and families where this is commissioned by a registered adoption agency.</p>

	  <h3>Doctoral research</h3>
	  <p>My doctoral thesis is entitled:</p>
	  <p><b>What did I do? I don't know. Generating fiction to examine the tacit maternal knowing I bring to my Theraplay® practice with children who are experiencing relational and developmental trauma.</b></p>
	  <p>In seeking to develop a richer understanding of what I do in my Theraplay practice with children who are experiencing relational and developmental trauma, I reflected on my embodied responses to my clinical Theraplay practice. I used a heuristic inquiry  process to create a safe space for not knowing. This enabled my self-search to lead to a creative synthesis in the form of a novella, <i>A Necessary Life(Story)</i>. The recursive/reflexive process, through the regular discipline of daily writing and alongside exposing myself to a wide range of literature, led to an explicit understanding of an ontological position that I realised I already held, but that I had never made consciously concrete.</p>
	  <p>A Necessary Life(Story) can be purchased as an <a href="https://tiny.cc/ANLS-ebook">eBook from Amazon</a> or as a <a href="https://tiny.cc/ANLS-novella">paperback from Ebay</a> for £9.99 (plus postage). The full thesis can be found on <a href="https://www.repository.cam.ac.uk/handle/1810/332742">Apollo</a>, the University of Cambridge repository</p><br>

	    <div class="text">
	      <p>Growing from my doctoral thesis <i>What did I do? I don't know.</i>, my blog <i>You Do Know</i> offers a practitioner's guide to using tacit maternal knowing to support children, young people, and their families. It will be of interest to professionals who practice as therapists, educators of therapists, researchers, or as managers of organisations who care. It may also be of interest to early years practitioners and to parents.</p>
	    </div>
		<p><i>You Do Know</i> is released on the first of every month. For each post I use a heuristic inquiry model, creating fiction to externalise, examine, and make sense of the tacit knowledge I use in my practice. I offer my thoughts and insights with the intention encouraging a community of practice to develop the theory, philosophy, and ethics of working in a way that starts from the practical application of attachment theory expressed and embodied via tacit maternal knowing. I call this speaking with our M/otherTongue. Radically and politically, by working out how to communicate our M/otherTongue, our community of practice will seek to transform how the less powerful are cared for by professionals who choose to use their power in the service of the other to promote equality, justice, and peace.</p>

    <h2>Counselling</h2>
    <hr>
    <p>Families are welcome to contact me to discuss the needs of their children. Organisations such as schools, voluntary organisations, independent fostering agencies, and local authorities are also welcome to commission services from me. When you contact me to discuss your needs, I will clearly outline how much any service will cost. Written details of cost will be provided on request.</p>
    <p>Counselling is a confidential service but working together is important to support children and families. The extent of and any limits to confidentiality will be made clear to all parties (children, parents/carers, commissioners etcetera) at the start of any piece of work.</p>
    <p>Counselling may be able to help children and young people find the emotional resources to manage all kinds of challenges and difficulties. For example:</p>
      <ul><li>stress at school including exam stress</li>
      <li> through bereavement or family breakdown</li>
      <li> managing change </li>
      <li> friendships </li>
      <li> managing the impact of ADHD or Aspergers Syndrome</li>
      <li>anger management</li></ul>
    <p>Sometimes children and young people can't find the words to say they are finding things difficult but may show their distress through behavioural difficulties or changes in their usual mood or activities. If you are concerned about your child and think counselling may help, please contact me for a free telephone consultation. If we think counselling could help, I may suggest seeing your child on their own, seeing you and your child together, or working with you as parent/carer in supporting your child. Appointments are offered in the Bedford area.</p>
