    <h2>About</h2>
    <hr style="width:100%;border:solid black"> 
      <p>Having worked for a CAMHS team specialising in looked after children for over a decade, working with children who are looked after or adopted is my primary interest and my main area of expertise. My doctoral study additionally focussed on the use of Theraplay with children who have experienced relational and developmental trauma of the kind that is often part of the early experiences of children who are looked after or adopted.</p>
      <p>Working through the lenses of attachment theory and Theraplay, I work with children, their families, and - where appropriate - their wider networks of adults, to cultivate a more secure attachment between child and their primary care givers.  Where necessary, I adapt Theraplay and integrate other modalities, although Theraplay remains my core model. I draw on sensory integration ideas,  trauma processing via bilateral stimulation, therapeutic life story work, parental psychoeducation and/or therapy, and non-directive play based methods.</p>
      <p>Each child and family receives a tailored package based on a Marschak Interaction Method (MIM) assessment and other assessments as required.</p>
      <p>Please note I can only take on work with adopted children and families where this is commissioned by a registered adoption agency.</p>

    <p>My doctoral thesis is entitled:</p>
      <p><b>What did I do? I don't know. Generating fiction to examine the tacit maternal knowing I bring to my Theraplay® practice with children who are experiencing relational and developmental trauma.</b></p>
    <p>In seeking to develop a richer understanding of what I do in my Theraplay practice with children who are experiencing relational and developmental trauma, I reflected on my embodied responses to my clinical Theraplay practice. I used a heuristic inquiry  process to create a safe space for not knowing. This enabled my self-search to lead to a creative synthesis in the form of a novella, A Necessary Life(Story). The recursive/reflexive process, through the regular discipline of daily writing and alongside exposing myself to a wide range of literature, led to an explicit understanding of an ontological position that I realised I already held, but that I had never made consciously concrete.</p>
    <p><b>A Necessary Life(Story) can be purchased as an <a href="https://tiny.cc/ANLS-ebook">eBook from Amazon</a> or as a<a href="https://tiny.cc/ANLS-novella">paperback from Ebay</a> for £9.99 (plus postage).</b></p>

    <h3 class="w3-center w3-strong">What people have said about A Necessary Life(Story)</h3>
      <p>A Necessary Life(Story) is an important and wonderful way to demonstrate all that goes into understanding a life--one's own and the lives of others.   It will make for very helpful and informative reading not only for our Theraplay colleagues, but for all who hope to understand and help people in distress--or more importantly, to understand and appreciate the life story of all the people in their world.</p>
	     <p><i><b>Phyllis Booth</b> MA, LCPC, LMFT, RPT/S, Founder (along with Ann Jernberg) of Theraplay® and formerly Clinical Director of the Theraplay Institute</i></p>
	<p>A Necessary Life(Story) captures what happens in Theraplay from the deepest level to the mundane picking the cotton wool off the rug before you leave the room that isn't yours. It also processes the actions and feelings in a way that will be very helpful to Theraplay practitioners and all readers with an interest in looked after and adopted children and families.
           <p><i><b>Sandra Lindaman</b>, MA, MSW, LCSW, LISW, training advisor and former executive director The Theraplay® Institute</i></p>
  	<p>I could relate to so much of A Necessary Life (Story) on many different levels. I always think we, as practitioners have to be very brave - to step into the worlds of the children we work with, to step, with both feet, into their trauma and feel it. I thought Fiona you were very brave, not only in the work but in revealing it in such an un-sanitised way.  For me, it helped to recognise the complexity, the messiness of it all, particularly with how it makes us feel.</p>
	     <p><i><b>Helen Maund</b>, SWE registered Social Worker, Certified Theraplay® Practitioner, Trainer, Supervisor</i></p> <br>

    <h3 class="w3-center w3-strong">You Do Know</h3>  
      <p>I additionally run a blog called You Do Know which is released on the first of every month. This futher explores my learning from my doctorate and offers a practitioner's guide to using Theraplay and tacit maternal knowing to support children and young people experiencing relational and developmental trauma.</p> 
      <img src="you-do-know.jpg" alt="The logo for You Do Know." class="w3-image center" width="30%"><br>
      <p>For each post, I take an excerpt from A Necessary Life(Story) and write about it. In small, digestible, and – I hope – interesting bits, I hope to share my learning from my doctoral research in a way that is useful to therapeutic practitioners. If you wish to read You Do Know or sign up to recieve new posts directly to your inbox, you can do so on <a href="https://tiny.cc/YDK">Substack</a>.</p>

    <h2>Counselling</h2>
    <hr style="width:100%;border:solid black">
    <p>Families are welcome to contact me to discuss the needs of their children. Organisations such as schools, voluntary organisations, independent fostering agencies, and local authorities are also welcome to commission services from me. When you contact me to discuss your needs, I will clearly outline how much any service will cost. Written details of cost will be provided on request.</p>
    <p>Counselling is a confidential service but working together is important to support children and families. The extent of and any limits to confidentiality will be made clear to all parties (children, parents/carers, commissioners etcetera) at the start of any piece of work.</p>
    <p>Counselling may be able to help children and young people find the emotional resources to manage all kinds of challenges and difficulties. For example:</p>
      <ul><li>stress at school including exam stress</li>
      <li> through bereavement or family breakdown</li>
      <li> managing change </li>
      <li> friendships </li>
      <li> managing the impact of ADHD or Aspergers Syndrome</li>
      <li>anger management</li></ul>
    <p>Sometimes children and young people can't find the words to say they are finding things difficult but may show their distress through behavioural difficulties or changes in their usual mood or activities. If you are concerned about your child and think counselling may help, please contact me for a free telephone consultation. If we think counselling could help, I may suggest seeing your child on their own, seeing you and your child together, or working with you as parent/carer in supporting your child. Appointments are offered in the Bedford area.</p>
